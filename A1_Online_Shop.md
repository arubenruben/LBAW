# A1:Online Shop

<!--Goals-->
The goal of this project is to develop a global marketplace which specializes in the sale of gaming related digital products using redemption keys. This website will not only offer a great variety of videogames for different platforms in a wide range of genres and ages, but also in-game purchable items.

<!--Business context, environment-->
More than ever consumers around world choose to buy their products online instead of the traditional physical stores. In addiction to this, the videogame industry is watching a huge economical growth and the majority of best sellers are now mainly focus on online gaming, being usually associated with plataforms like Steam or Origin. These platforms have their own digital marketplaces where digital games are mainly exchanged. <!--in-game collectibles, like character skins, potions or cards, used by online gamers as mean to improve their rankings or gameplay.--> 
<!-- Motivation -->
Although those platforms market's are not new, they are not well accepted by the game's industry stakeholders since they usually have strict protecionist policies against reselling and charge huge fees arguing the transaction's safety topics.
<!--Stakeholders-->
The main stakeholders of this platform are two: the buyer and the seller. The buyer <!--can be described as young person,  a gamer, with great capabilities in the WEB, showing confidence on his online peers. He-->looks for fast, on demand business, without burocracy, at the greatest price. He takes into account reviews from his peers, rather than having a personal contact with a physical store or sellor. The seller is a <!--person with knowledge of the gaming community also used to deal with the WEB. Could be a-->classic reseller who faces plenty of barriers while using classic platforms to exchange their products, but also could be gamers who received extra non-used redemption keys.<!--from game bundles, gifts or in-game collectives and want to avoid the huge taxes imposed to this micro transactions by those platforms.-->

For this reasons, nowadays, a plataform like the one proposed, friendly to reselling, highly focused on the community review and built for processing instantly the custommers demand is more than ever necessary to accommodate customers' needs and demands. 

<!-- Main Features -->
The website will have an adaptive design and a well crafted navigation system that allows users to search games by platform, category, genre and name. The user will be able to buy multiple products from different sellers at the same time using a shopping cart like system that will store the products until checkout.

Each product can have multiple sellers, offering different prices and having different ratings, empowering competion and freedom of choice. 

In the generical case a purchase is completed after the payment is successful, without the intervention of any kind of administrator. The key inserted by the seller will be automatically revealed to the buyer. In addiction, the platform will include a report feature that can be used by the user to alert the administrator if any kind of problem, such as an invalid key, occurs. As mention before, the platform will have an huge focus on the communitary reviewing, for that reason, after acquiring a key, the customer will gain the privilege to review the seller, helping community choice in the future.

After the purchase, information with purchase details, such as price and involved persons are added to the user menu dedicated to keep the record of all transactions.
<!--After the purchase, all the item's redemption keys as well as other purchase details such as price or seller/buyer identification and contact can be consulted in the personal user menu in the record of sales/buys men -->

The product's page will display the public offers available for that product as well as the rating and the username of the seller. Furthermore, as mention, after completing a purchase, a section dedicated to reviewing the quality of the transaction will be avaiable to the buyer.

<!-- Selling Features -->
The platform's database will save a record of the majority of game's titles, so that when publishing a sale, the sellor must specify the game the redemption key relates to according to a supplied list. This way, we improve the search in the website and avoid as possible, either administrator intervention and data misusing. One of the main functions of the administrator is to keep the database updated with new games.<!--In case the user wants to sell a product that is not on the database it has to make a request, that goes online after the aproaval of the administrator.-->

<!--When selling a product the seller must specify it by its name, and select it from the matches it has on the platform database. That way, when searching for a product there will only be a single listing will appear avoiding the administrator intervetion or any kind of data misusing. The majority of products will be avaiable in the database, but in case the user wants to sell a product that is not on the database it has to make a request, that goes online after the aproaval of the administrator. -->

While placing an offer to a specific product, a seller must upload the redemption key he wants to sell to the platform database. For that moment on the management of that key as well as the delivery to the correct customer according to the sucess of the payment will be from the responsability of the online platform.


<!-- User Authentication Features -->
The user will be able to create an account in the website and authenticate himself with a username and password. The username must be created on sign up. After registration the user will be able to access his account by using the platform' login feature. There is no distinction between an seller's and a buyer's account. In the platform every customer is at the same time a potencial seller.

<!-- Access Groups -->
There are 3 types of users. The unauthenticated user (guest) can only navigate through the website, search for products, consult the offers avaiable and view sellers' ratings, without the possibility to make transactions. 
The authenticated user can buy and sell products as also access the profile editing menu, where an user can change his personal details such as username, email, password and profile image. After making a purchase, the user gains the capability to write a review about that transaction. 
The administrator is a special type of account without the possibility to buy or sell items, and is also unable to write a review. On the other hand, has the capacity to delete offensive reviews, update products' details, block certain users from selling items, add games to the database, manage the reports made by users<!-- and review the already mentioned requests to add new games to the website's database.-->
